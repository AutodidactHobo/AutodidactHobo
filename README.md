WHO I AM
I’m a forensic strategist and operator specializing in OSINT investigations, fraud detection, and compliance engineering.
I endeavor to blend my strong financial foundation and operational clarity with adversarial thinking and custom-built intelligence tooling to expose what others miss - faster, and more reliably.

WHAT I DO
- **Investigate with precision**: I’ve audited municipalities, SMBs, vendors, and SAAS startups. I've traced data patterns and uncovered anomalies across ledgers, contracts, and internal control systems.
- **Design forensic workflows**: From API prompts to anomaly audit templates to shell company link analysis - I create lightweight, high-fidelity tools layman can actually use.
- **Build consent-first tech**: I design logic scaffolds and prompt governance systems for LLMs, with a focus on ethics, safety, auditability, and containment.

WHY I ROCK
**I don’t just audit systems — I interrogate them.**
I’ve managed financial operations under DOD oversight, enforced USCIS contractor compliance, and built forensic frameworks that surface what standard reviews miss. My thresholds are aggressive because risk doesn’t wait.

**I investigate like an adversary.**
From shell entities and coordinated vendor obfuscation to embedded internal weaknesses, I approach fraud like a threat actor would — probing blind spots, testing controls, tracing metadata and motive.

**I build tools that replace meetings.**
Every prompt, template, script, or audit flow I create is designed to cut friction, increase fidelity, and make actionable insight portable across teams. I don’t need a 12-person committee to find fraud. I just need access.
