WHO I AM -

I’m a forensic strategist and operator specializing in OSINT investigations, fraud detection, and compliance engineering.
I blend a strong financial foundation and high-fidelity operational clarity with adversarial thinking and custom-built intelligence tooling to expose what others miss - faster, and more reliably.

WHAT I DO -

- **Build consent-first tech**: I design logic scaffolds and prompt governance systems for LLMs, with a focus on things that are super unsexy in our culture: ethics, safety, auditability, and containment.
- **Investigate with precision**: I’ve audited municipalities, SMBs, vendors, and SAAS startups. I've traced data patterns and uncovered anomalies across ledgers, contracts, and internal control systems.
- **Design forensic workflows**: From API prompts to anomaly audit templates to shell company link analysis - I create lightweight, high-fidelity tools layman can actually use.
